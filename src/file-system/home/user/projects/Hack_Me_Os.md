This project aims to explore and experiment with the LC-3 architecture by creating and executing C programs that can be loaded and run on an LC-3 simulator. The end goal is to develop nanochess games and other scripts that can run directly on the LC-3 architecture. Inspired by : https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/
